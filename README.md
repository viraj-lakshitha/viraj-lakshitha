<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Viraj Lakshitha Bandara</h1>
<h3 align="center">Senior Software Engineer | Java (SpringBoot), React, Nest/Next & DevOps | MSc(Reading), BEng(UK)</h3>

<p>
I'm a senior backend engineer.

<br />

I'm all about crafting next-level SaaS solutions that make life easier for users and businesses alike. From designing smart architectures to rolling out game-changing features, I dive deep into cloud tech and serverless frameworks to make it all happen. Oh, and those CI/CD pipelines? I've turned them into well-oiled machines for faster, smoother deployments.

<br />

When I'm not in the thick of tech projects, I'm helping future engineers crack the code on cloud computing and big data as a research mentor. And because I'm a bit of a data nerd, I'm also leveling up my skills in Big Data Analytics with some intensive graduate studies
